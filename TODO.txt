TO DO LIST

*****1/17/18******

*Push code to GitHub
*DEBUG


*need light intensity of each individual leaf
	*convergence test->how small does the value need to be?
*visualization can take in parameters; output geometry 
	*use as set of parameters for validation
*need mesh structure
*need diffuse light -> multi bounce
	*recursive function (ray packet that gets absorbed can get re-emitted)


******1/30/18*******

*need to calculate geometry of leaves every time step -> growth of leaves based on photosynthetic rates (so light and parameters determine how the leaves will grow) -> output will be .ply file with geometry

*DEBUG
*move output stuff from main.cpp to writer.hpp
****write out simple file of just photosynthetic concentration (absorbed PPFD->direct and diffuse)
	D7_Meta file
	Column 1: Time Step
	Column 2: Photosynthetic rate
*change datatype of DOY from number to vector (from reader.hpp) for function calls in main.cpp
*generate test case of simple geometry to test with (i.e., 5 triangles that don't have to resemble a plant)
*write out geometry stuff to a .ply file
*have diffuse light, but need to check if absorbed rays can get re-emitted
*double check raytracer against Venkat's unreadable code to make sure all of the functions and calculations are covered in the raytracer
*compare raytracer and leaf system model (.m stuff) to see what variables will be needed and what can be discarded
*write output file of metabolite concentrations (D6 Meta file)


******2/15/18*******

*need to calculate geometry of leaves every time step -> growth of leaves based on photosynthetic rates (so light and parameters determine how the leaves will grow) -> output will be .ply file with geometry

*DEBUG
*Make sure updating the x, y, z components of each of the triangles based on growth from photosynthesis
****write out simple file of just photosynthetic concentration (absorbed PPFD->direct and diffuse)
	D7_Meta file
	Column 1: Time Step
	Column 2: Photosynthetic rate
*generate test case of simple geometry to test with (i.e., 5 triangles that don't have to resemble a plant)
*write out geometry stuff to a .ply file
*have diffuse light, but need to check if absorbed rays can get re-emitted
*double check raytracer against Venkat's unreadable code to make sure all of the functions and calculations are covered in the raytracer
*compare raytracer and leaf system model (.m stuff) to see what variables will be needed and what can be discarded
//*write output file of metabolite concentrations (D6 Meta file)
*go through stuff from Lpy guys
*fix parameter and constants references (sometimes they are referenced with & and other times they aren't)-->make it consistent


*PPFD --> micromole/second/meterSquared
